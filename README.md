# Introduction
As part of this project, I analyzed data on rejected and accepted Lending Club loans. The primary purpose of the EDA part was to indicate which features 
could have the most significant impact on a given model. The results also highlighted the difference between the two groups presented and pointed out 
the weaknesses of these data. In addition, 3 different machine learning models were created. Finally, a Fast API was designed for these models, and 
it was deployed in the Google cloud.

## API
It contains three different models that will return predictions about whether you will get a loan or not, and what type of grade or sub-grade you
will get. The fast api is deployed in google cloud. You can find all related files in the fastspi folder.
